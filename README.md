Project Document: Transform String And Image garalley
N.B: I have used Vistual Studio Code as IDE to Build this Project and Window as My Operating System
1. Introduction
Overview: This project involves transforming a string based on specific rules.
Purpose and Objectives: To demonstrate string manipulation techniques and problem-solving skills.
Scope and Limitations: The project focuses on transforming strings according to predefined rules.
2. Project Overview
Background Information: Strings often need to be manipulated in various applications for different purposes.
Project Goals and Deliverables: The goal is to develop a program that can transform strings according to specific rules, providing outputs based on the input string and predefined conditions.
3. Requirements Analysis
Functional Requirements:
The program should accept a string as input.
It should determine if the length of the string is divisible by 3 and/or 5.
Based on the conditions, it should perform the required transformations.
Non-functional Requirements:
The program should be efficient and able to handle large strings.
It should provide clear and concise output.
User Stories:
As a user, I want to input a string and see it transformed based on specific conditions.

4. Implementation
Technologies Used: JavaScript
5.Code Organization: The program will consist of a single JavaScript file containing the main logic.
Key Algorithms and Data Structures: String manipulation algorithms to check divisibility and perform transformations.
Testing Approach: Manual testing with various input strings to verify correctness.
